# citer
Citer is used to scrape opencitations.net to obtain the number of citations for a given list of publications. The function takes a vector of digital object identifiers (DOIs), iterates over that vector to collect the number of citations for each DOI, and then produces a two-column data frame of the original DOI and the number of citations.
